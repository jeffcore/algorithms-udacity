Your paragraph should not be a detailed walkthrough of the code you provided, but provide your reasoning behind decisions made in the code. For example, why did you use that data structure? You also need to explain the efficiency (time and space) of your solution.

Efficiency

There is a clear and accurate statement of efficiency. There is an explanation that specifically mentions parts of the code that contribute to the overall efficiency.

Code Design

Explanation contains some discussion of design choices made in the code. Some examples include the choice of algorithm and data structure.
