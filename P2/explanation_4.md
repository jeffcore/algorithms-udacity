# Problem 4

## Decisions Behind Code

Just a simple loop through the list and moving the 0 to the beginning and 2 to the end of the list.

## Efficiency

### Time Complexity

O(n) - Linear loop through list O(n) -  n being the number of elements in list.

### Space Complexity

Constant space of O(n) - n being the number of elements in list. Auxilary space of O(3) for start, end, index variables.  Final space complexity of O(n)
