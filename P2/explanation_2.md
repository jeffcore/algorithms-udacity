## Problem 2 - Dutch National Flag Problem

## Decisions Behind Code
The requirement for this project is to sort in one traversal, I used the strategy from the lessons to swap the 0's and 2's to the front and back of the list. 

## Efficiency

### Time Complexity
O(n) - n being number of elements in list. There is only a single tranversal of the list with possible constant time swap on each element. 

### Space Complexity
Since the algorithm is sorted in place the space complexity is O(1)
