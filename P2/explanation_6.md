# Problem 6 - Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

## Decisions Behind Code

Just did an single traversal over the list and compared the each element to a min and max variable.

## Efficiency

### Time Complexity

O(n) with n being the length of list for the single list traversal. All other operations were constant time O(1). Overall Time Complexity: O(n) with n being the length of list

### Space Complexity

Constant space: O(n) for the list, n being the number of elements in list.

Auxilary Space: O(2) additional for min and max variables

Total Space Complexity: O(n+2) simplfied to O(n) n being the number of elements in list.
