# Problem 4 - Active Groups

I used a recursive call on every group and iteration on groups' children.
The recrusive call would be called for every group and has a compexity of O(N) 
and the iteration on a group's children would be O(N). Entire complexity of function would be O(N), number of total users and groups.
