# Problem 2 - Find Files Recursive 

I used a recursive function to search each sub directory and iteration to search files in each subdirectory.  The time complexity is O(N), N being the total number of files in the entire directory tree. The total space is O(N) for a recursive tree for all directories and iteration over all files.
